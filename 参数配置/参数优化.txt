 How do you tune your InnoDB config ?
? 1) InnoDB METRICS table contains tons of stats to help you
? 2) monitor your free page requests, note the max levels you¡¯re hitting
? 3) you need to configure your LRU depth settings :?
innodb_lru_scan_depth = free pages demand / BP instances
? 4) innodb_page_cleaners = BP instances
? 5) monitor your flushing times to be sure your total time on every pass is < 1sec
? 6) if not => increase BP instances & cleaners & adjust LRU depth accordingly
? but if your storage is slow, you may just see a HUGE slowdown due IO reads and
nothing else.. ;-))
