show profiles;
show profile for query 1;
这个的输出是按照执行的顺序输出的，没有按消耗的时间排序输出
select state,sum(duration) as total_r,round(100*sum(duration)/(select sum(duration) from information_schema.profiling where query_id=???),2) as pct_r,count(*) as calls, sum(duration)/count(*) as "r/call' from information_schema.profiling where query_id=?? group by state order by total_r desc;
