Change of the place where MySQL stores temporary tables. InnoDB temporary tables are stored in ibtmp1 tablespace file. There are a number of challenges with that:
Location of the ibtmp1 file. By default it is located inside the innodb datadir. Originally MyISAM temporary tables were stored in  tmpdir. We can configure the size of the file, but the location is always relative to InnoDB datadir, so to move it to tmpdir we need something like this:  innodb_temp_data_file_path=../../../tmp/ibtmp1:12M:autoextend
Like other tablespaces it never shrinks back (though it is truncated on restart). The huge temporary table can fill the disk and hang MySQL (bug opened). One way to fix that is to set the maximum size of ibtmp1 file:  innodb_temp_data_file_path=ibtmp1:12M:autoextend:max:1G
Like other InnoDB tables it has all the InnoDB limitations, i.e., InnoDB row or column limits. If it exceeds these, it will return ¡°Row size too large¡± or ¡°Too many columns¡± errors. The workaround is to set internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine to MYISAM.

When all temp tables go to InnoDB, it may increase the total engine load as well as affect other queries. For example, if originally all datasets fit into buffer_pool and temporary tables were created outside of the InnoDB, it will not affect the InnoDB memory footprint. Now, if a huge temporary table is created as an InnoDB table it will use innodb_buffer_pool and may ¡°evict¡± the existing pages so that other queries may perform slower.
